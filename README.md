This is a little ray tracer I built following [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf) (and a bit of Ray Tracing the Next Week). I chose Java because it was for a school course and it was my only option and I regret it deeply, as do the fans of my poor laptop.
